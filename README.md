ðŸ‘‹Hi, this is my third project at 'Al-bunyan al-mersus' progrmming contest. it is a car shop e-commerce app with React.js.

Through this project i used the following additional tools
  1. React redux\toolkit
  2. React slick
  3. React scroll
  4. Heroicons...

In this app the user can order any car he/she wants and the ordered cars will be shown on cart section, and also from cart section the user can remove or add more quantity of the car.
